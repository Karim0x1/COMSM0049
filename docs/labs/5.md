# COMSM0049: Lab 5: Fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop

In this lab, we will learn to fuzz using AFL---an open source fuzzer. 

We will also explore a shortcoming of fuzzing, i.e. detection of information leak. Information leak is a type of buffer overread bug. Read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_over-read). The main issue is that such vulnereabilities do not result in any observable side-effects so as to enable fuzzing to detect it (WHY?). [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) is a particularly nasty vulnerability that made news in 2014. We will try and get our fuzzer to detect it in this lab.

Current versions of the Clang C compiler have features called _sanitizers_ that are used as memory guard checks by statically instrumenting memory at different level of granularity. One of such sanitizers is called AddressSanitizer (ASan). This sanitizer is used to detected out-of-bound memory access. Which means that when we allocate memory, say on heap, it puts a "red-zone" around the allocated buffer. So, when at runtime, if we overwrite/read the buffer, we touch these red-zones, thereby aborting the program. [wiki for more refs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer)

We have implemented a simple version of heartbleed vulnerability. Check [heartbleed.c](heartbleed.c). Read the comments in the code to find out what is the bug and how it can be triggered. Our goal for the lab is to find the bug via fuzzing. You will need a seed input to start fuzzing. use [heartbeat_normal.bin](heartbeat_normal.bin) as seed input.

** Instructions

1. Copy the above seed input, and source into the `temp-in` directory (done for you on VM).  If you're running on your own machine compile and install AFL from [https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/]
2. Compile heartbleed.c as follows:

   		cd AFL
   		afl-clang ../heartbleed.c -o test-bins/heartbleed

3. Run AFl fuzzer as follows:

   		afl-fuzz -i temp-in/ -o temp-out/ test-bins/heartbleed @@

4. you will (most probably) see certain warning/suggestions from AFL, like below (and what I did):

		sanjay@sanjay-lap:~/tools/AFL$ ./afl-fuzz -i temp-in/ -o 		temp-out test-bins/heartbleed @@
		afl-fuzz 2.56b by <lcamtuf@google.com>

		[*] Checking core_pattern...
		
		[-] Hmm, your system is configured to send core dump notifications to an

		    between stumbling upon a crash and having this information relayed to the
		    fuzzer via the standard waitpid() API.
		    To avoid having crashes misinterpreted as timeouts, please log in as root
		    and temporarily modify /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern, like so:
		
		    echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

		    afl-fuzz. To keep things moving, run these commands as root:
		
		    cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
		    echo performance | tee cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
		
		    You can later go back to the original state by replacing 'performance' with
		    'ondemand'. If you don't want to change the settings, set AFL_SKIP_CPUFREQ
		    to make afl-fuzz skip this check - but expect some performance drop.

5. At this time, you will enter into the TUI of AFL. Let you fuzzer run for 10-15 min. While it is running, read docs/status_screen.txt to know what that TUI means and how you interprete fuzzing progress. After that see if you are getting any crash. In this case, you will not find any!! Remember it is a information leak bug, which will not result in a crash.
6. Stop the fuzzer (ctrl C). Check temp-out directory to find more about fuzzing results, like queue (what inputs were generated by fuzzer) and crash (if any!).
7. Now, lets try making program crash on overread, by using sanitizer. Compile the heartbleed.c again with the following options.

		afl-clang -m32 -fsanitize=address <path to>/heartbleed.c -o test-bins/heartbleed-asan

8. Notice two extra options. *-fsanitize=address* to enable address sanitizer and *-m32* to make it 32-bit as ASan allocates crazy amount of VA, which creates problem at times.
9. Run fuzzer as:

		afl-fuzz -i temp-in/ -o temp-out test-bins/heartbleed-asan @@

10. Most probably, you will again see the follwing warnings/suggestions:

		afl-fuzz 2.56b by <lcamtuf@google.com>

		[-] Whoops, the target binary crashed suddenly, before receiving any input
		    from the fuzzer! Since it seems to be built with ASAN and you have a
		    restrictive memory limit configured, this is expected; please read
		    /usr/local/share/doc/afl/notes_for_asan.txt for help.
		
		[-] PROGRAM ABORT : Fork server crashed with signal 6
		         Location : init_forkserver(), afl-fuzz.c:2213
	
11. Run the fuzzer again with an extra option *-m*:

		afl-fuzz -m 1024 -i temp-in/ -o temp-out test-bins/heartbleed-asan @@

12. fuzzer should start now..

		sanjay@sanjay-lap:~/tools/AFL$ afl-fuzz -m 1024 -i temp-input/ -o temp-out/ test-bins/heartbleed-asan @@

		[*] No -t option specified, so I'll use exec timeout of 40 ms.
		[+] All set and ready to roll!
		
13. Now, check the crash field in TUI. In the crash field, you will see number of crashes. Let the fuzzer run for 15-20 min. Number of unique crashes should increase (max will be ~5). One of them should (hopefully) be your heartbleed bug (hurray :D ).
14. Stop the fuzzer and check the temp-out/crashes directory. there should be few inputs, corresponding to crashes.
15. for each of those inputs, run the following command:

		$ ./test-bins/heartbleed-asan <input>

16. One input should give you the following output:

			==28681==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0xf59007b7 at pc 0xf7a5b8be bp 0xffffce28 sp 0xffffc9f8

		    #5 0x565562cf  (/home/sanjay/tools/AFL/test-bins/heartbleed-asan+0x12cf)
		    
		    
	NOTE: the way AFL names crashing inputs, sometimes the above step may not show you the same output, because the input path was not interpreted properly. in that case, either use quotes or rename the inputs to some simpler names.
