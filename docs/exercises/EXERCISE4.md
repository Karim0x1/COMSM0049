# Exercises sheet 4
## Static Analysis: 
1. What do you understand by a complete and sound program analysis technique?
2. What are the code patterns (constructs) that, in general, makes static analysis hard or inaccurate?
3. What do you understand by fix-point iteration from dataflow analysis point of view?
4. What is a transfer function for a dataflow analysis
5. What is a interprocedural control flow graph?
## Dynamic Analysis:
1. Why does a whole program analysis (all possible executions) is an issue for a dynamic analysis?
2. What is program instrumentation?
3. "Often static code instrumentation is faster than dynamic instrumentation"-- What do you think about it and why?
