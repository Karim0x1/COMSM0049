# Systems & Software Security Coursework

## Introduction

This project validates the whole unit, there is no other assessment. It represents a significant investment of time and effort that should mostly take place during Week 8, 9 and 10. Unlike previously unassessed labs, you will work on an open-ended project that you will choose from a list. We encourage you to form groups of 3 students. You will need as part of the project to submit: a proposal, your code + video and a final write up. Some projects have been designed to leverage material you may have learned in other units, this is by design. Security is not a silo and encompasses a large number of computer science sub-disciplines.

We expect every member of a group to participate fully in the project. You are free to organise as you wish, but your personal contribution will be evaluated and need to be demonstrated (see below). If you have any concern about your group dynamic, do contact us via e-mail.
