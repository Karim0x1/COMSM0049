# Systems & Software Security Coursework

## Introduction

This project validates the whole unit, there is no other assessment. It represents a significant investment of time and effort that should mostly take place during Week 8, 9 and 10. Unlike previously unassessed labs, you will work on an open-ended project that you will choose from a list. We strongly suggest you form groups of 3 students. You will need as part of the project to submit: a proposal, your code + video and a short write up. Some projects have been designed to leverage material you may have learned in other units, this is by design. Security is not a silo and encompasses a large number of computer science sub-disciplines.

We expect every member of a group to participate fully in the project. You are free to organise as you wish, but your personal contribution will be evaluated and need to be demonstrated (see below). If you have any concern about your group dynamic, do contact us via e-mail.

Do remember this is a level 7 unit (i.e. Master-level), consequently, you need to demonstrate independent work and ambition beyond what would be expected from BSc students.

## Form a group

It is the studentsâ€™ responsibility to form their groups. You should e-mail us ([thomas.pasquier@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:thomas.pasquier@bristol.ac.uk) and [sanjay.rawat@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sanjay.rawat@bristol.ac.uk)) your group no later than the Thursday of Week 7. In addition, provide one or two paragraph(s) description of your project. We will provide short feedback to all groups. If you need further feedback, contact us to schedule a meeting (if WE think you need more feedback, we will tell you too).
