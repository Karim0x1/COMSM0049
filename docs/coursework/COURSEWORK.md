# Systems & Software Security Coursework

## Introduction

This project validates 20 credits of work. It represents a significant investment of time and effort that should mostly take place during Week 8, 9 and 10. Unlike previously unassessed labs, you will work on an open-ended project that you will choose from a list. You will form groups of 3 students. You will need as part of the project to submit: your code, a short write up and prepare for an individual viva. Some projects have been designed to leverage material you may have learned in other units, this is by design. Security is not a silo and encompasses a large number of computer science sub-disciplines.

We expect every member of a group to participate fully in the project. You are free to organise as you wish, but your personal contribution will be evaluated and need to be demonstrated (see below). If you have any concern about your group dynamic, do contact us via e-mail.

Do remember this is a level 7 unit (i.e. Master-level), consequently, you need to demonstrate independent work and ambition beyond what would be expected from BSc students.
Deliverable

## Form a group

It is the students’ responsibility to form their groups. You will have an extremely hard time completing this coursework alone. You should e-mail us ([thomas.pasquier@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:thomas.pasquier@bristol.ac.uk) and [sanjay.rawat@bristol.ac.uk](mailto:sanjay.rawat@bristol.ac.uk)) your group no later than the Thursday of Week 7. In addition, provide a two paragraphs description of your project. We will provide short feedback to all groups. If you need further feedback, contact us to schedule a meeting (if WE think you need more feedback, we will tell you too).


## Submission

### Project proposal - group (graded 10%)

By the Wednesday of Week 8, you need to have finalised a proposal of your project. You will describe the problem you aim to tackle. The main objective of this deliverable is to ensure that everyone is on track and that you have thought through what you need to do. Your proposal should be at most 2 A4 pages following [USENIX Latex conference template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates). and contain the following information:
- The group members;
- The problem you aim to address;
- How you plan to address it;
- A short summary of one or two relevant academic papers;
- What you are proposing to implement exactly.

**Submission Instructions:** TBC

### Project demonstration - group (grade 20%)

You will demonstrate that your solution works. You will submit a video demonstrating your project. Your project should be coming with a README. You will follow the readme instruction and demonstrate that you obtain the results presented in the paper and that you can reproduce the evaluation. The video should be no longer than 10 minutes.

The easiest way to record your “screen” is to use OBS or ZOOM.

**Submission Instructions:** TBC

### Final write up - group (graded 40%)

You should submit a 4 pages report (excluding reference and appendix) following [USENIX Latex conference template](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates). Your report should contain a minimum of six academic citations. We suggest the following structure:
Introduction
Background
Design & Implementation
Evaluation
Conclusion

Do not hesitate to use figures to illustrate your point, well-drawn figures can communicate more than a thousand words.

**Submission Instructions:** TBC

### Short presentation - individual (graded 30%)

You will individually present your project to both lecturers + one TA. You will provide an overview of the whole project and highlight your individual contributions. You will be expected to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the project. You should prepare a 5 minutes presentation that will be followed by 10 minutes of questions. The questions will cover both the presentation and the overall project.
