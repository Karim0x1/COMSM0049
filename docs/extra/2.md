## Exercises

- Explain what is meant by an arena, a heap, and a chunk and how they
  relate? (5 marks)
- To defend against use after free attacks, Alice has the following
  macro defined:
  
  `#define FREE(x) { free(x); x = NULL; }`
  
  Is that going to be sufficient to stop the vulnerability and why?
  What tradeoffs are being made?  What about compiler optimizations?
  (5 marks)
- The [CHERI architecture](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) is a (really cool) new instruction set
  architecture that makes it impossible to exploit buffer overflows by
  replacing _pointers_ with _capabilities_; that is bounded data
  structures that provide hardware protection against buffer overflows
  by ensuring that all pointers are bounds checked (they're not just
  an address but instead a base address and an offset that defines the
  permissible range, that can't be fiddled with via register
  arithmetic).  Speculate on whether these new capabilities would also
  protect against heap overflow attacks in particular use after free.
  
  
...okay maybe that last one would be rather mean for an exam; speculate away and we can discuss in the next lab if anyone is keen!

(also... Microsoft have recently anounced that they'll including support for CHERI primitives in the latest version of Windows; sometimes research really does become *real world* technology!)
